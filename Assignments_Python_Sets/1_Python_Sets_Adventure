# Task 1: Flight Route Comparison
# Objective: Compare the flight routes of your airline with a competitor

# Defining sets for our routes and competitor routes
our_routes = {"LAX", "JFK", "CDG", "DXB"}
competitor_routes = {"JFK", "CDG", "LHR", "BKK"}

# 1. Destinations that both airlines fly to (intersection)
shared_routes = our_routes.intersection(competitor_routes)
print("Destinations that both airlines fly to:", shared_routes)

# 2. Destinations unique to our airline (difference)
unique_our_routes = our_routes.difference(competitor_routes)
print("Destinations unique to our airline:", unique_our_routes)

# 3. Check if there are destinations that neither airline shares 
unique_to_both = our_routes.symmetric_difference(competitor_routes)
print("Destinations that are unique to either airline (not shared):", unique_to_both)
